# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a supervised machine learning model to predict the **selling price of used cars** based on various features like age, fuel type, kilometers driven, ownership status, etc.

The model is trained using **regression algorithms** and the process is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`car_price_predict.ipynb`).

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Data preprocessing and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- 📉 Model training using **Random Forest Regressor**
- 🧪 Performance evaluation using R² Score and MAE
- 💾 Model serialization using `pickle` for deployment
